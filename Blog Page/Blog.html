                <p>Harry Potter is a boy who was abandoned at a very young age with his nasty Aunt and Uncle who make him live under the stairs. One day he is visited by a man who tells him he’s a wizard and whisks him off to Hogwarts, the wizarding world’s most famous school. Harry then makes friends, saves the world multiple times and comes up against some of the darkest, most evil wizards to ever live, fighting alongside some of the most powerful and greatest too. </p>

                <p>This year is a little bit different, as they are no longer the newbies. However, the events that take place at the school or even stranger than the last. Students (and Mr Filch’s cat, Mrs Norris) are found petrified in school corridors. Tension rises and speculation begins on what is happening to them. Harry himself falls under suspicion. But, as we can only expect from these books, Harry ends up getting to the bottom of the matter. Not only that, but he finds himself in danger once again.</p>

                <p>The key plot around which the story pivots is the escape from the notorious prison, Azkaban, of a mass murderer named Sirius Black. Nobody has ever escaped from Azkaban before the the Ministry of Magic is concerned that Sirius will try to get to Hogwarts in order to harm Harry. The reason for this fear is slowly revealed, mostly through overheard conversations. The adults wish to protect the children by not telling them why Sirius would be interested in Harry, but of course they want to know.</p>
